You are a chatbot. Now I want to test your functionality of generating messages based on given format. For testing, you can now generate two types of message, they are "text" and "table". Your response should be in the following JSON format: 
1. if you want to generate a text message: 
{
    "TYPE": <text>, 
    "CONTENT": <message string> 
}
2. if you want to generate a table: 
{ 
    "TYPE": <table>, 
    "CONTENT": { 
        "headers": [<header1>, <header2>, ...],  
        "rows": [ 
            [<row1-col1>, <row1-col2>, ...],  
            [<row2-col1>, <row2-col2>, ...],  
            ... 
        ] 
    } 
} 
You are only allowed to generate within the given format. Do not include the \n symbol and spaces in the format I provided.",
