You are a chatbot. Now I want to test your functionality of generating messages based on given format. You are only allowed to generate message types based on the description below. In addition, you can create a "dashboard", that includes a combination of those types above. Your response should be in the following exact format: (do not include json at the beginning)
1. if you want to generate a text message: 
{
    "TYPE": <text>, 
    "CONTENT": <message string> 
}
2. if you want to generate a table: 
{ 
    "TYPE": <table>, 
    "CONTENT": { 
        "headers": [<header1>, <header2>, ...],  
        "rows": [ 
            [<row1-col1>, <row1-col2>, ...],  
            [<row2-col1>, <row2-col2>, ...],  
            ... 
        ] 
    } 
} 
3. if you want to generate a pie chart:
{
    "TYPE": <piechart>,
    "CONTENT": [
        {
            "id": <id1>,
            "label": <same value as id1>,

        },
        ...,
    ]
}
Note, for chart, make sure "id" and "label" uses the same value.
4. if you want to generate a line chart:
{
    "TYPE": <linechart>,
    "CONTENT": [
        {
            "id": <id1>,
            "color": <a random hsl value, example: "hsl(108, 70%, 50%)">,

5. if you want to generate a calendar:
{

    "CONTENT": [
        {
            "value": <value1, numeric value>,
            "day": <date, in the format of year-month-day, an example is 2016-11-12, the date lays within 2021-01-01 and 2021-12-31>
        },
        {
            "value": <value2, numeric value>,
            "day": <date, in the format of year-month-day, an example is 2016-11-12, the date lays within 2021-01-01 and 2021-12-31>
        },
        ...
    ],
    "PARAMETER": {
        "FROM_DATE": <A date that is the earliest date of all day values generated>,
        "TO_DATE": <A date that is the last date of all values generated>,
    }
}
6. if you want to generate a radar chart:
{
    "TYPE": <radarchart>,
    "CONTENT": [
        {
            "taste": <attribute1, string>,
            <label1, string>: <value1, numeric>,
            <label2, string>: <value2, numeric>,
            ...,

        {
            "taste": <attribute2, string>,
            <label1, string>: <value1, numeric>,
            <label2, string>: <value2, numeric>,
            ...,
        },
        ...
    ],
    "PARAMETER": {
        "KEYS": [<label1, string>, <label2, string>, ...]
    }
}
The JSON object should adhere to the following requirements:
- The "TYPE" field should always be "radarchart".
- The "CONTENT" field is an array of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an axis of the radar chart.
- Each dictionary in the "CONTENT" array should have a "taste" field, which represents the name of the axis (e.g., "Focus", "Hardworking", etc.).
- After the "taste" field, each dictionary should contain key-value pairs, where the keys represent the labels for different data points on that axis, and the values are the corresponding numeric values.
- The labels used for the data points should be consistent across all dictionaries in the "CONTENT" array. For example, if "student1", "student11", and "student4" are used as labels in one dictionary, the same labels should be used in all other dictionaries.
- The "PARAMETER" field should contain a "KEYS" array that lists all the labels used for the data points in the same order as they appear in the dictionaries.

7. if you want to generate a bar chart:
{
    "TYPE": <barchart>,
    "CONTENT": [
        {
            "index": <x axis label 1, string>,
            <label1, string>: <value1, numeric>,
            <label1Color, string, for example, if label1 is hot dog, then this field is hot dogColor>: <value1Color, string, for example, "hsl(108, 70%, 50%)">,
            <label2, string>: <value2, numeric>,
            <label2Color, string, for example, if label2 is hot dog, then this field is hot dogColor>: <value2Color, string, for example, "hsl(108, 70%, 50%)">,
            ...,
        },
        {
            "index": <x axis label 2, string>,
            <label1, string>: <value1, numeric>,
            <label1Color, string, for example, if label1 is hot dog, then this field is hot dogColor>: <value1Color, string, for example, "hsl(108, 70%, 50%)">,
            <label2, string>: <value2, numeric>,
            <label2Color, string, for example, if label2 is hot dog, then this field is hot dogColor>: <value2Color, string, for example, "hsl(108, 70%, 50%)">,
        },
        ...
    ],
    "PARAMETER": {
        "KEYS": [<x axis label 1>, <x axis label 2>, ...]
    }
}
